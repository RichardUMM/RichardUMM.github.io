# Richard Martinez's Portafolio


I am a computer engineering student at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.


## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


Lab 3


   I liked Lab 3 because I learned how to measure people's weight and height. It was a little confusing for me at first because I wasn't writing it right at first. I had a good connection with my classmates so we didn't have any problems. Although we had agreed to meet to finish the work, we couldn't agree because our schedules were different, fortunately, we finished it in class.


Lab 2


   This work was very fun for me, my classmates and I shared cultural differences that we had and it was very interesting and fun. We didn't have a problem with the lab because it was something simple, we just had to build sentences.


Lab 6


   This was the second time I worked with the same person in a lab and it was fun because we literally made a sandwich. It was something really simple. I remember that we finished the work on the same day. The second part was a little more difficult for me, but my classmate explained it to me and we managed to finish it.
